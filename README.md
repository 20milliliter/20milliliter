### Who am I?

Hi! I'm "Millie", and I like programming, video-games, music, and visual media. I live for where they intersect.

My primary portfolio is available on [my website](https://20ml.live), as Github is (reasonably) not well suited for displaying such media.
However, many software projects and my contributions to open-source endeavors are viewable here.
